        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.</p>
        <p>Players take turns placing their symbols on the grid. The first player to get three in a row wins. If all nine cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.</p>
